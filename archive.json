This can be a per-message basis.\r\n\r\nI would suggest \"Stream-Body\" or \"Incr[emental]-Delivery\" or even just \"Incremental\".  This is a signal from the sender of that message to any intermediary that incremental delivery of this message would be optimal.  Importantly, a request can't speak about a response.",
