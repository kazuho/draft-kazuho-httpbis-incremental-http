                      Streaming Requests for HTTP
             draft-kazuho-httpbis-streaming-requests-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies the "Request-Streaming" HTTP request header
   field, which instructs HTTP intermediaries to begin forwarding the
   request and the corresponding response before the HTTP message body
   is received completely.

1.  Introduction

   HTTP [HTTP] is a request-response protocol that allows servers to
   start transmitting a response before the entire HTTP request has been
   received.  Some applications, such as Chunked Oblivious HTTP Messages
   [CHUNKED-OHTTP], exploit this capability to turn a single HTTP
   request-response pair into a medium for bi-directional communication,
   on which multiple application-defined request-response message pairs
   are exchanged.

   However, this approach is fragile when HTTP intermediaries are
   involved.  HTTP intermediaries are not only allowed but are
   frequently deployed to buffer complete HTTP requests before
   forwarding them to the backend server (Section 7.6 of [HTTP]).

   Should such a buffering HTTP intermediary be present between the
   client and the server, the application in question fails to function
   as intended.  Upon sending the HTTP header section and the initial
   application message, the client awaits a response while keeping the
   HTTP request open for subsequent application messages.  Concurrently,
   the intermediary delays forwarding until the HTTP request is fully
   received.  This misalignment leads to a deadlock that prevents the
   exchange of application-defined messages, effectively disrupting the
   intended bi-directional communication.

   To prevent such deadlocks, this document specifies the "Request-
   Streaming" HTTP request header field, that instructs HTTP
   intermediaries to begin forwarding the HTTP request downstream before
   receiving the complete request.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The Request-Streaming Header Field

   The Request-Streaming request header field expresses the client's
   intent for HTTP intermediaries to start forwarding the request to
   downstream servers before the entire request is received.

   This header field has just one valid value: "1".  Its syntax is
   defined by the following ABNF [ABNF]:

   Request-Streaming = 1

   Upon receiving a header section that includes the Request-Streaming
   header field, HTTP intermediaries SHOULD NOT buffer the entire
   request before forwarding it.  Instead, intermediaries SHOULD
   establish an HTTP channel to downstream servers, transmit the header
   section, and continuously forward the bytes of the request body as
   they arrive.

   Similarly, intermediaries SHOULD forward the bytes of the response
   body to the clients as they are received.

4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  Applying Concurrency Limits

   To conserve resources required to handle HTTP requests or
   connections, it is common for intermediaries to impose limits on the
   maximum number of concurrent HTTP requests, while buffering requests
   that exceed this limit.

   Intermediaries may apply a more restrictive concurrency limit to
   streaming requests to ensure that there remains capacity to process
   non-streaming requests, even when the maximum number of long-lived
   streaming requests is reached.  This approach helps balance the
   processing of different types of requests and maintains service
   availability across all request types.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
